# AlpineApartment

This is the source code for the Chalet Captain Thorpe holiday apartment website.
The site is built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) and deployed to GitHub Pages.

## Development

To run the website locally for development, follow these steps:

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    This will build the site and serve it at `http://localhost:8080`. The browser will automatically reload when you save changes.

## Deployment

The website is hosted on GitHub Pages.

To manually build and deploy the site, run the following command. This will create a production build in the `_site` folder and push its contents to the `gh-pages` branch.
```bash
npm run deploy
```
